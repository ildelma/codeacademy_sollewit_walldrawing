# CodeAcademy Sol LeWit's wall drawing project
This is the p5.js code for the Sol LeWit wall drawing project in the CodeAcademy "Learn p5.js" course.
This project is available only for pro users of CodeAcademy, but the result that ones has to achieve is shown on this youtube video from their official channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR06jWwfQ3I
Some steps' descriptions are shown in the video, but it doesn't fully go through the whole project neither it actually shows how to reach the end result. Anyway, the video is useful for who is starting to learn p5.js, so I thought it would be nice to publish a solution to the projects for the ones like me that do not have a pro subscription to CodeAcademy's platform.
